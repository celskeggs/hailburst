 * Delay a task for a given number of ticks.  The actual time that the
 * task remains blocked depends on the tick rate.  The constant
 * portTICK_PERIOD_MS can be used to calculate real time from the tick
 * rate - with the resolution of one tick period.
 *
 * INCLUDE_vTaskDelay must be defined as 1 for this function to be available.
 * See the configuration section for more information.
 *
 *
 * vTaskDelay() specifies a time at which the task wishes to unblock relative to
 * the time at which vTaskDelay() is called.  For example, specifying a block
 * period of 100 ticks will cause the task to unblock 100 ticks after
 * vTaskDelay() is called.  vTaskDelay() does not therefore provide a good method
 * of controlling the frequency of a periodic task as the path taken through the

 * at which vTaskDelay() gets called and therefore the time at which the task
 * next executes.  See xTaskDelayUntil() for an alternative API function designed
 * to facilitate fixed frequency execution.  It does this by specifying an
 * absolute time (rather than a relative time) at which the calling task should
 * unblock.
 *
 * @param xTicksToDelay The amount of time, in tick periods, that

 * See the configuration section for more information.
 *
 * Delay a task until a specified time.  This function can be used by periodic
 * tasks to ensure a constant execution frequency.
 *
 * This function differs from vTaskDelay () in one important aspect:  vTaskDelay () will
 * cause a task to block for the specified number of ticks from the time vTaskDelay () is
 * called.  It is therefore difficult to use vTaskDelay () by itself to generate a fixed
 * execution frequency as the time between a task starting to execute and that task
 * calling vTaskDelay () may not be fixed [the task may take a different path though the
 * code between calls, or may get interrupted or preempted a different number of times
 * each time it executes].
 *
 * Whereas vTaskDelay () specifies a wake time relative to the time at which the function
 * is called, xTaskDelayUntil () specifies the absolute (exact) time at which it wishes to
 * unblock.
 *
 * The macro pdMS_TO_TICKS() can be used to calculate the number of ticks from a
 * time specified in milliseconds with a resolution of one tick period.
 *
 * @param pxPreviousWakeTime Pointer to a variable that holds the time at which the
 * task was last unblocked.  The variable must be initialised with the current time
 * prior to its first use (see the example below).  Following this the variable is
 * automatically updated within xTaskDelayUntil ().
 *
 * @param xTimeIncrement The cycle time period.  The task will be unblocked at
 * time *pxPreviousWakeTime + xTimeIncrement.  Calling xTaskDelayUntil with the
 * same xTimeIncrement parameter value will cause the task to execute with
 * a fixed interface period.
 *
 * @return Value which can be used to check whether the task was actually delayed.
 * Will be pdTRUE if the task way delayed and pdFALSE otherwise.  A task will not
 * be delayed if the next expected wake time is in the past.

 *
 * See https://www.FreeRTOS.org/RTOS-task-notifications.html for details.
 *
 * Sends a direct to task notification to a task, with an optional value and
 * action.
 *
 * Each task has a private array of "notification values" (or 'notifications'),
 * each of which is a 32-bit unsigned integer (uint32_t).  The constant
 * configTASK_NOTIFICATION_ARRAY_ENTRIES sets the number of indexes in the
 * array, and (for backward compatibility) defaults to 1 if left undefined.
 * Prior to FreeRTOS V10.4.0 there was only one notification value per task.
 *
 * Events can be sent to a task using an intermediary object.  Examples of such
 * objects are queues, semaphores, mutexes and event groups.  Task notifications
 * are a method of sending an event directly to a task without the need for such
 * an intermediary object.
 *
 * A notification sent to a task can optionally perform an action, such as
 * update, overwrite or increment one of the task's notification values.  In
 * that way task notifications can be used to send data to a task, or be used as
 * light weight and fast binary or counting semaphores.
 *
 * A task can use xTaskNotifyWaitIndexed() or ulTaskNotifyTakeIndexed() to
 * [optionally] block to wait for a notification to be pending.  The task does
 * not consume any CPU time while it is in the Blocked state.
 *
 * A notification sent to a task will remain pending until it is cleared by the
 * task calling xTaskNotifyWaitIndexed() or ulTaskNotifyTakeIndexed() (or their
 * un-indexed equivalents).  If the task was already in the Blocked state to
 * wait for a notification when the notification arrives then the task will
 * automatically be removed from the Blocked state (unblocked) and the
 * notification cleared.
 *
 * **NOTE** Each notification within the array operates independently - a task
 * can only block on one notification within the array at a time and will not be
 * unblocked by a notification sent to any other array index.
 *
 * Backward compatibility information:
 * Prior to FreeRTOS V10.4.0 each task had a single "notification value", and
 * all task notification API functions operated on that value. Replacing the
 * single notification value with an array of notification values necessitated a
 * new set of API functions that could address specific notifications within the
 * array.  xTaskNotify() is the original API function, and remains backward
 * compatible by always operating on the notification value at index 0 in the
 * array. Calling xTaskNotify() is equivalent to calling xTaskNotifyIndexed()
 * with the uxIndexToNotify parameter set to 0.
 *
 * @param xTaskToNotify The handle of the task being notified.  The handle to a
 * task can be returned from the xTaskCreate() API function used to create the
 * task, and the handle of the currently running task can be obtained by calling
 * xTaskGetCurrentTaskHandle().
 *
 * @param uxIndexToNotify The index within the target task's array of
 * notification values to which the notification is to be sent.  uxIndexToNotify
 * must be less than configTASK_NOTIFICATION_ARRAY_ENTRIES.  xTaskNotify() does
 * not have this parameter and always sends notifications to index 0.
 *
 * @param ulValue Data that can be sent with the notification.  How the data is
 * used depends on the value of the eAction parameter.
 *
 * @param eAction Specifies how the notification updates the task's notification
 * value, if at all.  Valid values for eAction are as follows:
 *
 * eSetBits -
 * The target notification value is bitwise ORed with ulValue.
 * xTaskNotifyIndexed() always returns pdPASS in this case.
 *
 * eIncrement -
 * The target notification value is incremented.  ulValue is not used and
 * xTaskNotifyIndexed() always returns pdPASS in this case.
 *
 * eSetValueWithOverwrite -
 * The target notification value is set to the value of ulValue, even if the
 * task being notified had not yet processed the previous notification at the
 * same array index (the task already had a notification pending at that index).
 * xTaskNotifyIndexed() always returns pdPASS in this case.
 *
 * eSetValueWithoutOverwrite -
 * If the task being notified did not already have a notification pending at the
 * same array index then the target notification value is set to ulValue and
 * xTaskNotifyIndexed() will return pdPASS.  If the task being notified already
 * had a notification pending at the same array index then no action is
 * performed and pdFAIL is returned.
 *
 * eNoAction -
 * The task receives a notification at the specified array index without the

 *
 * A version of xTaskNotifyIndexed() that can be used from an interrupt service
 * routine (ISR).
 *
 * Each task has a private array of "notification values" (or 'notifications'),
 * each of which is a 32-bit unsigned integer (uint32_t).  The constant
 * configTASK_NOTIFICATION_ARRAY_ENTRIES sets the number of indexes in the
 * array, and (for backward compatibility) defaults to 1 if left undefined.
 * Prior to FreeRTOS V10.4.0 there was only one notification value per task.
 *
 * Events can be sent to a task using an intermediary object.  Examples of such
 * objects are queues, semaphores, mutexes and event groups.  Task notifications
 * are a method of sending an event directly to a task without the need for such
 * an intermediary object.
 *
 * A notification sent to a task can optionally perform an action, such as
 * update, overwrite or increment one of the task's notification values.  In
 * that way task notifications can be used to send data to a task, or be used as
 * light weight and fast binary or counting semaphores.
 *
 * A task can use xTaskNotifyWaitIndexed() to [optionally] block to wait for a
 * notification to be pending, or ulTaskNotifyTakeIndexed() to [optionally] block
 * to wait for a notification value to have a non-zero value.  The task does
 * not consume any CPU time while it is in the Blocked state.
 *
 * A notification sent to a task will remain pending until it is cleared by the
 * task calling xTaskNotifyWaitIndexed() or ulTaskNotifyTakeIndexed() (or their
 * un-indexed equivalents).  If the task was already in the Blocked state to
 * wait for a notification when the notification arrives then the task will
 * automatically be removed from the Blocked state (unblocked) and the
 * notification cleared.
 *
 * **NOTE** Each notification within the array operates independently - a task
 * can only block on one notification within the array at a time and will not be
 * unblocked by a notification sent to any other array index.
 *
 * Backward compatibility information:
 * Prior to FreeRTOS V10.4.0 each task had a single "notification value", and
 * all task notification API functions operated on that value. Replacing the
 * single notification value with an array of notification values necessitated a
 * new set of API functions that could address specific notifications within the
 * array.  xTaskNotifyFromISR() is the original API function, and remains
 * backward compatible by always operating on the notification value at index 0
 * within the array. Calling xTaskNotifyFromISR() is equivalent to calling
 * xTaskNotifyIndexedFromISR() with the uxIndexToNotify parameter set to 0.
 *
 * @param uxIndexToNotify The index within the target task's array of
 * notification values to which the notification is to be sent.  uxIndexToNotify
 * must be less than configTASK_NOTIFICATION_ARRAY_ENTRIES.  xTaskNotifyFromISR()
 * does not have this parameter and always sends notifications to index 0.
 *
 * @param xTaskToNotify The handle of the task being notified.  The handle to a
 * task can be returned from the xTaskCreate() API function used to create the
 * task, and the handle of the currently running task can be obtained by calling
 * xTaskGetCurrentTaskHandle().
 *
 * @param ulValue Data that can be sent with the notification.  How the data is
 * used depends on the value of the eAction parameter.
 *
 * @param eAction Specifies how the notification updates the task's notification
 * value, if at all.  Valid values for eAction are as follows:
 *
 * eSetBits -
 * The task's notification value is bitwise ORed with ulValue.  xTaskNotify()
 * always returns pdPASS in this case.
 *
 * eIncrement -
 * The task's notification value is incremented.  ulValue is not used and
 * xTaskNotify() always returns pdPASS in this case.
 *
 * eSetValueWithOverwrite -
 * The task's notification value is set to the value of ulValue, even if the
 * task being notified had not yet processed the previous notification (the
 * task already had a notification pending).  xTaskNotify() always returns
 * pdPASS in this case.
 *
 * eSetValueWithoutOverwrite -
 * If the task being notified did not already have a notification pending then
 * the task's notification value is set to ulValue and xTaskNotify() will
 * return pdPASS.  If the task being notified already had a notification
 * pending then no action is performed and pdFAIL is returned.
 *
 * eNoAction -
 * The task receives a notification without its notification value being
 * updated.  ulValue is not used and xTaskNotify() always returns pdPASS in
 * this case.
 *
 * @param pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken  xTaskNotifyFromISR() will set
 * *pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken to pdTRUE if sending the notification caused the
 * task to which the notification was sent to leave the Blocked state, and the
 * unblocked task has a priority higher than the currently running task.  If
 * xTaskNotifyFromISR() sets this value to pdTRUE then a context switch should
 * be requested before the interrupt is exited.  How a context switch is
 * requested from an ISR is dependent on the port - see the documentation page
 * for the port in use.
 *
 * @return Dependent on the value of eAction.  See the description of the
 * eAction parameter.

 * used as a faster and lighter weight binary or counting semaphore alternative.
 * Actual FreeRTOS semaphores are taken using the xSemaphoreTake() API function,
 * the equivalent action that instead uses a task notification is
 * ulTaskNotifyTakeIndexed().
 *
 * When a task is using its notification value as a binary or counting semaphore
 * other tasks should send notifications to it using the xTaskNotifyGiveIndexed()
 * macro, or xTaskNotifyIndex() function with the eAction parameter set to
 * eIncrement.
 *
 * ulTaskNotifyTakeIndexed() can either clear the task's notification value at
 * the array index specified by the uxIndexToWaitOn parameter to zero on exit,
 * in which case the notification value acts like a binary semaphore, or
 * decrement the notification value on exit, in which case the notification
 * value acts like a counting semaphore.
 *
 * A task can use ulTaskNotifyTakeIndexed() to [optionally] block to wait for
 * a notification.  The task does not consume any CPU time while it is in the
 * Blocked state.
 *
 * Where as xTaskNotifyWaitIndexed() will return when a notification is pending,
 * ulTaskNotifyTakeIndexed() will return when the task's notification value is
 * not zero.
 *
 * **NOTE** Each notification within the array operates independently - a task
 * can only block on one notification within the array at a time and will not be
 * unblocked by a notification sent to any other array index.
 *
 * Backward compatibility information:
 * Prior to FreeRTOS V10.4.0 each task had a single "notification value", and
 * all task notification API functions operated on that value. Replacing the
 * single notification value with an array of notification values necessitated a
 * new set of API functions that could address specific notifications within the
 * array.  ulTaskNotifyTake() is the original API function, and remains backward
 * compatible by always operating on the notification value at index 0 in the
 * array. Calling ulTaskNotifyTake() is equivalent to calling
 * ulTaskNotifyTakeIndexed() with the uxIndexToWaitOn parameter set to 0.
 *
 * @param uxIndexToWaitOn The index within the calling task's array of
 * notification values on which the calling task will wait for a notification to
 * be non-zero.  uxIndexToWaitOn must be less than
 * configTASK_NOTIFICATION_ARRAY_ENTRIES.  xTaskNotifyTake() does
 * not have this parameter and always waits for notifications on index 0.
 *
 * @param xClearCountOnExit if xClearCountOnExit is pdFALSE then the task's
 * notification value is decremented when the function exits.  In this way the
 * notification value acts like a counting semaphore.  If xClearCountOnExit is
 * not pdFALSE then the task's notification value is cleared to zero when the
 * function exits.  In this way the notification value acts like a binary
 * semaphore.
 *
 * @param xTicksToWait The maximum amount of time that the task should wait in
 * the Blocked state for the task's notification value to be greater than zero,
 * should the count not already be greater than zero when
 * ulTaskNotifyTake() was called.  The task will not consume any processing
 * time while it is in the Blocked state.  This is specified in kernel ticks,
 * the macro pdMS_TO_TICKS( value_in_ms ) can be used to convert a time
 * specified in milliseconds to a time specified in ticks.
 *
 * @return The task's notification count before it is either cleared to zero or
 * decremented (see the xClearCountOnExit parameter).
